## Line Coverage Description


Based on the unit tests in problem one, that were designed based on funtionallity rather then linecoverage, we did not reach 100% linecovarage on all java files.
But the tests created in problem two all acheive full line coverage (100%). 

There are also alot of previously mentioned faults in the code that makes it so our tests,
that are designed based on method descriptions rather then the method functionallity.
